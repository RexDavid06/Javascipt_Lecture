we declare a variable in javascript using the "let" keyword
    "let num = 5"

you don't have to declare a variable multiple times 
     "let num = 5"
     after this you can now say 
      "num = 10"

when naming a variable, the only special symbols allowed are 
    " $ and _"
    and you don't start a variable name with a number

There are two types of naming rules.
    camel sasing rule = "userName"
    snake sasing rule = "user_name"

In declaring variables in javascript, there variables that are not to be changed and there are those that will be modified
    "const num = 90" this variable can not be changed
    "let num = 90" now this one is changedable
